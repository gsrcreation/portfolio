# GSR — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work, skills, and creative journey.

The portfolio is designed with a clean dark theme, subtle animations, and a focus on visual storytelling. It reflects my interest in design, creativity, and my growing journey toward technology.
